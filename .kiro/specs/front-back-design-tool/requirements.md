# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing design tool to support front and back design capabilities for products. Administrators will have control over which products support this functionality, can upload separate templates for front and back designs, and users will be able to design both sides with proper visual guidelines including bleed lines and safe zones.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to enable front/back design options for specific products, so that I can control which products support dual-sided design capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the Django admin panel THEN the system SHALL display a checkbox field to enable front/back design for each product
2. WHEN the front/back design option is enabled for a product THEN the system SHALL allow template uploads for both front and back sides
3. WHEN the front/back design option is disabled for a product THEN the system SHALL hide front/back selection options in the design tool
4. IF a product has front/back design enabled THEN the system SHALL require at least one template (front or back) to be uploaded

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to upload separate design templates for front and back sides, so that users have appropriate templates for each side of their design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uploads templates for a front/back enabled product THEN the system SHALL provide separate upload fields for front and back templates
2. WHEN uploading a front template THEN the system SHALL label it clearly as "Front Template"
3. WHEN uploading a back template THEN the system SHALL label it clearly as "Back Template"
4. WHEN both templates are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate that both templates have compatible dimensions
5. IF only one template is uploaded THEN the system SHALL allow users to design only that specific side

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select whether to design the front, back, or both sides of a product, so that I can create designs according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the design tool for a front/back enabled product THEN the system SHALL display options to select "Front Only", "Back Only", or "Both Sides"
2. WHEN a user selects "Front Only" THEN the system SHALL load only the front template and design canvas
3. WHEN a user selects "Back Only" THEN the system SHALL load only the back template and design canvas
4. WHEN a user selects "Both Sides" THEN the system SHALL provide tabs or navigation to switch between front and back design canvases
5. IF a product only has one template available THEN the system SHALL automatically select the corresponding side option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see bleed lines and safe zones while designing, so that I can ensure my design meets printing requirements and important elements are properly positioned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is designing on any canvas THEN the system SHALL display bleed lines as red colored borders
2. WHEN a user is designing on any canvas THEN the system SHALL display safe zones as black colored borders
3. WHEN bleed lines are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned at the outer edges of the printable area
4. WHEN safe zones are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned to indicate the area where important content should be placed
5. WHEN switching between front and back designs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent bleed line and safe zone indicators
6. IF the user zooms or pans the canvas THEN the bleed lines and safe zones SHALL remain visible and properly scaled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly switch between front and back design views when designing both sides, so that I can create cohesive designs across both sides of the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is designing both sides THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation controls to switch between front and back views
2. WHEN switching from front to back view THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved changes on the current side
3. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate template and maintain design elements for each side
4. WHEN saving the design THEN the system SHALL save both front and back designs as separate but linked components
5. IF a user has made changes to one side THEN the system SHALL indicate which sides have been modified

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain backward compatibility with existing single-sided products, so that current functionality remains unaffected by the new front/back feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product does not have front/back design enabled THEN the system SHALL function exactly as it currently does
2. WHEN loading the design tool for a non-front/back product THEN the system SHALL not display front/back selection options
3. WHEN existing single-sided designs are accessed THEN they SHALL load and function without any changes
4. IF a product is later enabled for front/back design THEN existing single-sided designs SHALL remain accessible and functional
