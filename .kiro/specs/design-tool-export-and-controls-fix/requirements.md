# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the design tool where guide lines (bleed lines and safe zones) are being exported with the final design, and the color/background controls in the navigation bar are not functioning properly. The system needs to ensure that visual guides remain as non-exportable elements and that all color controls work seamlessly for design elements and canvas background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to export my design without the bleed lines and safe zone guides, so that I get a clean final output suitable for production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports their design THEN the system SHALL exclude bleed lines from the exported image
2. WHEN a user exports their design THEN the system SHALL exclude safe zone lines from the exported image  
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL only include actual design elements (text, images, shapes, etc.)
4. WHEN bleed lines are visible on canvas THEN they SHALL remain visible during design but not appear in exports
5. WHEN safe zone lines are visible on canvas THEN they SHALL remain visible during design but not appear in exports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the color picker in the navigation bar to work properly, so that I can quickly change the color of selected design elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a design element is selected AND a user clicks the color picker THEN the system SHALL open the color selection interface
2. WHEN a user selects a color from the picker THEN the selected design element SHALL immediately update to that color
3. WHEN a user clicks on preset color swatches THEN the selected element SHALL change to that color instantly
4. WHEN no element is selected AND user tries to use color picker THEN the system SHALL show a message indicating no element is selected
5. WHEN multiple elements are selected THEN the color picker SHALL apply the chosen color to all selected elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the background color picker to work properly, so that I can change the canvas background color effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the background color picker THEN the system SHALL open the color selection interface
2. WHEN a user selects a background color THEN the canvas background SHALL immediately update to that color
3. WHEN a user clicks preset background color swatches THEN the canvas background SHALL change instantly
4. WHEN the background color changes THEN it SHALL not affect any design elements on the canvas
5. WHEN exporting the design THEN the background color SHALL be included in the exported image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer, I want visual feedback when using color controls, so that I can understand which elements will be affected by color changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over the color picker THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating its function
2. WHEN an element is selected THEN the color picker SHALL show the current color of that element
3. WHEN multiple elements with different colors are selected THEN the color picker SHALL show a mixed color indicator
4. WHEN no element is selected THEN the color picker SHALL be visually disabled or show an appropriate state
5. WHEN the background color picker is active THEN it SHALL clearly indicate it affects the canvas background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the guide lines to be properly managed as non-exportable overlay elements, so that they serve their purpose as visual aids without interfering with the final output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN guide lines are rendered THEN they SHALL be created as overlay elements separate from the main canvas
2. WHEN the canvas is manipulated THEN guide lines SHALL remain properly positioned relative to the canvas
3. WHEN zooming in or out THEN guide lines SHALL scale appropriately with the canvas
4. WHEN guide lines are toggled on/off THEN they SHALL show/hide without affecting design elements
5. WHEN the canvas is cleared or reset THEN guide lines SHALL remain available for the new canvas state
