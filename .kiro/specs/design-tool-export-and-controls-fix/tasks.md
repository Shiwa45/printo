# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create guide overlay system to separate guide lines from main canvas


  - Create GuideOverlayManager class that manages a separate HTML5 canvas for guide lines
  - Position overlay canvas exactly over the main Fabric.js canvas with CSS absolute positioning
  - Implement createOverlay() method to create and configure the overlay canvas element
  - Add pointer-events: none CSS to overlay so clicks pass through to main canvas
  - Write unit tests for overlay canvas creation and positioning
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1_



- [ ] 2. Implement guide line drawing on overlay canvas
  - Move bleed line drawing logic from main canvas to overlay canvas
  - Move safe zone line drawing logic from main canvas to overlay canvas
  - Implement drawBleedLines() method using overlay canvas 2D context
  - Implement drawSafeZoneLines() method using overlay canvas 2D context
  - Add proper line styling (color, width, dash patterns) for guide lines


  - Write unit tests for guide line drawing accuracy and styling
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 5.2_

- [ ] 3. Synchronize overlay with main canvas transformations
  - Implement syncWithMainCanvas() method to match overlay position and scale with main canvas
  - Add event listeners for main canvas zoom, pan, and resize operations
  - Update overlay dimensions and positioning when main canvas changes


  - Ensure guide lines remain properly positioned during all canvas transformations
  - Add requestAnimationFrame optimization for smooth overlay updates
  - Write tests for overlay synchronization during canvas operations
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 4. Update guide visibility controls to work with overlay system
  - Modify existing toggleBleedLines() function to show/hide overlay canvas


  - Modify existing toggleSafeZone() function to control overlay visibility
  - Implement toggleVisibility() method in GuideOverlayManager
  - Update UI controls to properly interact with overlay system
  - Ensure guide visibility state persists correctly
  - Write tests for guide visibility toggle functionality
  - _Requirements: 5.4_


- [ ] 5. Fix color picker event handlers and element targeting
  - Debug and fix event binding for navColorPicker element
  - Implement proper element selection detection using Fabric.js selection events
  - Create handleElementColorChange() method that applies color to selected objects
  - Add validation to ensure color is only applied when elements are selected
  - Implement visual feedback when no elements are selected
  - Write tests for color picker functionality with various selection states
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_


- [ ] 6. Fix background color picker functionality
  - Debug and fix event binding for bgColorPicker element
  - Implement handleBackgroundColorChange() method using Fabric.js backgroundColor property
  - Ensure background color changes don't affect design elements
  - Add immediate visual feedback when background color changes
  - Implement background color persistence during canvas operations
  - Write tests for background color functionality


  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 7. Implement color control state management
  - Create ColorControlManager class to manage color picker states
  - Add updateSelectedElements() method to track current selection
  - Implement updateColorPickerState() method to show current element colors
  - Add visual indicators for mixed colors when multiple elements are selected


  - Implement disabled state for color picker when no elements are selected
  - Write tests for color control state management
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Add visual feedback and tooltips for color controls
  - Add tooltips to color picker elements explaining their function
  - Implement hover effects for color picker and preset color swatches

  - Add visual indication when background color picker is active
  - Create feedback messages for color control operations
  - Implement color preview functionality before applying changes
  - Write tests for visual feedback and user interaction elements
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.5_

- [ ] 9. Update export system to exclude guide overlays
  - Verify that existing export functions only target main Fabric.js canvas

  - Ensure overlay canvas is completely excluded from all export operations
  - Add export validation to confirm no guide lines appear in exported images
  - Implement getExportPreview() method to show clean export preview
  - Test export functionality with guides enabled and disabled
  - Write comprehensive tests for export system validation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 10. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms


  - Implement error handling for overlay canvas creation failures
  - Add fallback behavior when color picker operations fail
  - Create error recovery for canvas synchronization issues
  - Add user-friendly error messages for color control failures
  - Implement graceful degradation when overlay system is unavailable
  - Write tests for error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: All requirements - error handling_

- [ ] 11. Optimize performance and add monitoring
  - Implement dirty flag system to avoid unnecessary overlay redraws
  - Add debouncing for color change events to prevent excessive updates
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth overlay animations
  - Add performance monitoring for export operations
  - Optimize guide line drawing with efficient canvas operations
  - Write performance tests for overlay system and color controls
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 12. Integration testing and validation
  - Test complete workflow: design creation, guide visibility, color changes, and export
  - Validate that exported images contain no guide lines under all conditions
  - Test color picker functionality with various element types and selections
  - Verify background color changes work correctly with all canvas operations
  - Test guide overlay system with zoom, pan, and canvas resize operations
  - Create end-to-end tests for the complete design and export workflow
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
