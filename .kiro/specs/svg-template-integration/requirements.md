# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the design tool to work with uploaded SVG templates where the canvas automatically adjusts to match the template dimensions. The system will manage bleed lines and safe zones based on the template specifications, providing a professional design experience that adapts to various template sizes and formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to upload SVG templates to my design tool, so that I can create designs based on predefined layouts and dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the template upload option THEN the system SHALL display a file picker that accepts SVG files
2. WHEN a user selects an SVG file THEN the system SHALL validate that it is a proper SVG format
3. WHEN an SVG template is uploaded THEN the system SHALL parse the SVG dimensions and display the template in a template library
4. IF the SVG file is invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the canvas to automatically resize to match my selected template dimensions, so that I can work within the correct design boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an SVG template THEN the canvas SHALL automatically resize to match the template's width and height
2. WHEN the canvas resizes THEN the system SHALL maintain the aspect ratio of the template
3. WHEN a template is applied THEN the system SHALL display the template as a background layer that cannot be edited
4. WHEN switching between templates THEN the canvas SHALL smoothly transition to the new dimensions
5. IF no template is selected THEN the canvas SHALL use the default dimensions specified in canvas settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want bleed lines to automatically adjust based on my template size, so that I can ensure my design extends properly beyond the cut line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is loaded THEN the system SHALL calculate bleed lines based on the template dimensions and configured bleed size
2. WHEN bleed lines are enabled THEN the system SHALL display red guide lines extending beyond the template boundaries
3. WHEN the bleed size is modified THEN the bleed lines SHALL update in real-time to reflect the new measurements
4. WHEN a user toggles bleed line visibility THEN the lines SHALL show or hide without affecting the design elements
5. IF the template has embedded bleed specifications THEN the system SHALL use those values instead of default settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer, I want safe zones to automatically adjust based on my template size, so that I can keep important content within printable areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is loaded THEN the system SHALL calculate safe zone boundaries based on template dimensions and safety margins
2. WHEN safe zones are enabled THEN the system SHALL display green guide lines inside the template boundaries
3. WHEN the safe zone margin is modified THEN the safe zone lines SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN a user toggles safe zone visibility THEN the lines SHALL show or hide without affecting design elements
5. IF the template has embedded safe zone specifications THEN the system SHALL use those values instead of default calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to manage my uploaded templates, so that I can organize and reuse them efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in a template library with thumbnails
2. WHEN viewing the template library THEN the system SHALL display template name, dimensions, and preview thumbnail
3. WHEN a user wants to delete a template THEN the system SHALL provide a delete option with confirmation
4. WHEN a user searches templates THEN the system SHALL filter templates by name or dimensions
5. WHEN templates are stored THEN the system SHALL persist them across browser sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the rulers and canvas controls to adapt to template dimensions, so that I can accurately position elements within the design space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is loaded THEN the rulers SHALL adjust their scale to match the template dimensions
2. WHEN the canvas resizes THEN the ruler markings SHALL recalculate to show accurate measurements
3. WHEN zooming in or out THEN the ruler scale SHALL adjust proportionally
4. WHEN working with different unit systems THEN the rulers SHALL display measurements in the appropriate units (mm, px, inches)
5. IF the template specifies measurement units THEN the rulers SHALL default to those units
